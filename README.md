### How to install ISM (Internet Speed Measurement)
First you need to clone from GitHub the ISM repository by running this command on your terminal 
```
git clone https://github.com/TRKako/ISM
```

Once you cloned this repository you have to install all the dependencies; To do this, run this command on your terminal
```
npm i
```
Now you are done with the installation!

## How to use ISM
The first thing you have to do is get a TOKEN from the API of [Fast.com](https://fast.com/)

Im not going to enter in detail since I already explained it in the script, to see this instructions you only need to run the "run.bat" file, you will get an error because there's no TOKEN, in the same error you will get a full explanation of how to get said TOKEN, if you have any question you can ask it in [Issues](https://github.com/TRKako/ISM/issues/new)

After you are ready with the TOKEN, you are ready to start using ISM, now you can run "run.bat" and it will begin to measure your internet Speed.

## You are ready!
Thank you for using this repo, just made it for fun tbh
